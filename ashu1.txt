I have a grandmother that is not fluent in any language.
 I don't mean any disrespect on her, because she has helped her family get through so many hard times,

 but she cannot speak any lanuage with precision.

She was born in Vietnam, but her parents escaped when she was 3 to China. 
There, she learned Cantonese and Mandarin for a few years before moving to Europe. 
There, she learned German, French, Spanish, and English. Eventually, she moved to America,



 where she remains today.

With only a few years learning the different languages, she didn't become fluent in any of them.
 She speaks Cantonese and Mandarin with most of her friends in private, but speaks to her family in English.

 One of her daughters lives in France, so she can speak to her in French.

Though her "native language" is Vietnamese, she only spoke it for the first 3–5 years of her life, 
so she cannot remember it well. She started learning English much later in her life, so she has had a hard time becoming fluent in it
